Nosepass
Dunno, probably some sort of rpg.

Nosepass
I'll ask Skitty what kind of game she would like to make.

*Pikachu's Pokedex vibrates*
Skitty: Want to meet up to talk about the project?

Pikachu
Skitty just asked if we want to meet up to talk about the project.

Nosepass
Okay, what time and when?

Pikachu
Let me ask her...

Pikachu
How about Saturday at 3:00PM?

Pikachu
Oh and she asked for your number too.

Nosepass
Yeah, I don't have anything planned on Saturday.

Nosepass
How about you?

Pikachu
I have work for the theatre at that time, sorry.

Nosepass
Alright, it's cool and go ahead give her my number.

Pikachu
'Kay.

-Day 2-


Mew
Hey Eevee, I know you've been working on your own. But for the group project, why don't you join a group?

Eevee
Okay.

Eevee
Hey Skitty, I don't have a group for the project, can I join your group?

Skitty
Sure, let me ask the others.

Eevee
What are you guys doing for the project?

Skitty
I think we're making a game, we still have to meet up and talk about it though.

Eevee
Oh okay.

-------
Pikachu
Hey Nosepass.

Nosepass
Sup.

Pikachu
Skitty just texted me, she asked if her friend could join the group.

Nosepass
Who?

Pikachu
Dunno, Eevee?

Pikachu
Do you know her?

Nosepass
Nope, I have no idea who she is.

Pikachu
Me neither, what should we do?

Nosepass
Hm...I'll let you decide.

Pikachu
Eh...okay,

Nosepass
Ask Skitty who she is and what she's like.

Pikachu
Sure...

Pikachu
Anna said

Nosepass
Okay, I don't really mind, it's up to you.

Pikachu
Okay, I'll just tell Skitty we said yes.

Nosepass
Sure thing.

-------
Skitty's Pokedex
Pikachu >> Skitty: Yeah, Eevee can join us.

Skitty's Pokedex
Skitty >> Eeve: Pikachu and Nosepass said they are fine with you joining!

Skitty's Pokedex
Eevee >> Skitty: Awesome, thanks.

-Day 3-


Nosepass' Pokedex
Skitty >> Nosepass: Hi Nosepass, I'm outside your dorm, do you think you can let me in?

Nosepass
Hey Skitty.

Skitty
Hey.

Nosepass
I'm upstairs so let's go to the second floor lounge.

Skitty
Okay.

Nosepass
Oh and Pikachu's working so he won't be with us.

Skitty
Okay, that's fine.

-------
Nosepass
So, for the project, pretty sure we're making a game... what kind of game do you wanna make? Like, do you want to make an RPG, 2D side scrolling or dungeon crawling game?

Skitty
I'm not sure, but I think an RPG would be nice.

Nosepass
Alright, wanna see a few example games of whatever type? We can watch them on PokeTube.

Skitty
Sure.

Skitty
For the dungeon crawling type of game, I have a few ideas we can do for it.

Nosepass
So you want to do a dungeon crawling game?

Skitty
Hmm... maybe. But not like the ones you showed me, they're a bit too dark and grim. Maybe we can do the dungeon crawling in an outside environment.

Nosepass
Maybe, well we also have to see what Pikachu and Eevee might want to do. I think Eric might want to do an RPG.

Skitty
Yeah, an RPG sounds nice.

Nosepass
For an RPG, what kind would you want to do? Like, medieval fantasy, high fantasy, sci-fi, contemporary...

Skitty
Maybe fantasy, with magic and elves and stuff.

Nosepass
Okay, I'll tell Eric and ask what he thinks, could you ask Eevee what kind of games she want to make?

Skitty
Sure.
